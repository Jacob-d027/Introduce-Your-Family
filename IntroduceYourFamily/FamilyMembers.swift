let michael = FamilyMember(photoName: "Michael.jpg", name: "Michael", info: "My youngest blood related brother. It is weird to put his name as \"Michael\" as everyone calls him Mikey.

Though he may act nonchalant and harsh sounding, he is a very sweet person who holds deep emotions and truly values the relationships he has.")
